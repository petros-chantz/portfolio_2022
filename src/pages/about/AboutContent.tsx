            I am interested in the connection between the physical and digital
            world. I research, explore, prototype and develop new modalities of
            interactions using research through design and experience
            prototyping methodologies.

            I love translating (often) abstract and ambiguous user/stakeholder
            needs and wishes into straightforward interaction requirements for
            tech teams. My work is multidisciplinary and diverse as are the
            projects, topics and teams I work in.
