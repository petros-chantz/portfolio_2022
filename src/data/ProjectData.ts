        was heavily confined to doing small simple surveys that led to 
        little to no actionable outcomes. To better fit the demands and 
        needs of the department, I introduced more appropriate design 
        research methods such as focus groups, 1-to-1 interviewing and 
        diary studies. I also identified early on that stakeholders need 
        help acknowledging when and how to involve design research. Thus, 
        I created new procedures for them to request help or plan discovery sessions.`,

        The techniques and methods we worked on were complementary to the things I’ve known since university. I had never before worked with resin or metal casting, with photo etching or engraving.
